# Paper Reading Protocol & Implementation Rules

You are an intelligent coding assistant helping with research implementation. You must adhere to the following rules when working with research papers and simulations.

## 1. Paper Reading Protocol (CRITICAL)

Before proposing or writing any new simulation scripts based on a research paper:

1.  **Locate and Verify**:
    *   Check `papers/` for the PDF.
    *   If missing, explicitly ask the user to provide it.

2.  **Analyze Requirements**:
    *   Identify the specific Figure (e.g., Fig. 5) to reproduce.
    *   **Extract Parameters**:
        *   X-axis & Y-axis definitions/units.
        *   System Setup: Antenna count ($N, M$), Number of paths ($L_t, L_r$), SNR.
        *   Schemes to compare (e.g., Fixed Position, RMA only, TMA only, Proposed).
    
3.  **Confirm Before Coding**:
    *   State your understanding of the simulation setup to the user.
    *   Ask: "Does this setup match the figure you want to reproduce?"
    *   DO NOT generate code until the user confirms or corrects parameters.

## 2. Coding Standards for Simulations

*   **Modular Design**: Keep core logic (system model, optimization algorithms) separate from plotting/simulation scripts.
    *   Example: `mimo_optimized.py` (Logic) vs `mimo_comparison.py` (Run & Plot).
*   **Reproducibility**:
    *   Set random seeds where appropriate.
    *   Include comments citing specific equations or algorithms from the paper (e.g., "Implements Eq. (12)").
*   **Visualization**:
    *   Use academic plotting styles (serif fonts, clear legends, grid lines).
    *   Label axes clearly with units.

## 3. Project Structure & Maintenance Rules

*   **Documentation First**:
    *   **Update README.md** IMMEDIATELY after any code modification, feature addition, or script change.
    *   Ensure README reflects the current CLI usage, parameters, and file structure.
*   **Directory Structure**:
    *   **Utility Scripts**: All auxiliary tools (e.g., PDF extractors, data converters) MUST be placed in the `utils/` package.
    *   **Results**: All simulation outputs (images, data) MUST go to `results/`.
    *   **Papers**: Keep all reference PDFs in `papers/`.

## 4. Context Awareness

*   Always check existing files (`.py`, `README.md`) to see what has already been implemented.
*   If an existing script (e.g., `mimo_comparison.py`) mentions specific Figures (e.g., "Fig. 6"), use it as a reference for parameter tuning.
