Abstract— This paper explores the rate-energy (R-E) region of
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer for MIMO
broadcasting channel under the nonlinear radio frequency energy
harvesting (EH) model. The goal is to characterize the tradeoff
between the maximal energy transfer versus information rate.
The separated EH and information decoding (ID) receivers and
the co-located EH and ID receivers scenarios are considered.
For the co-located receivers scenario, both time switching (TS)
and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures are investigated.
Optimization problems are formulated to derive the boundaries
of the R-E regions for the considered systems. As the problems
are nonconvex, we ﬁrst transform them into equivalent ones
and derive some semi-closed-form solutions, and then design
efﬁcient algorithms to solve them. Numerical results are provided
to show the R-E regions of the systems, which provide some
interesting insights. It is shown that all practical circuit speciﬁ-
cations greatly affect the system R-E region. Compared with the
systems under traditional linear EH model, the ones under the
nonlinear EH model achieve smaller R-E regions due to the lim-
itations of practical circuit features and also show very different
R-E tradeoff behaviors.

networks (WBANs) [1]–[4]. It was reported that with current
available EH circuits, microwatts to milliwatts of power can be
harvested from received RF signals over the range of several
meters with a transmit power of 1 Watt and a carrier frequency
less than 1 GHz [4].
One important application of RF-EH is simultaneous wire-
less information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the
same RF signal is used to transfer both energy and infor-
mation, which potentially offers great possibility to replen-
ish power and transmit information to energy-constrained
devices (e.g., low-power sensor nodes) [5]–[10]. In [5],
the single-input single-output (SISO) channel was considered,
where a capacity-energy function was proposed to character-
ize the fundamental tradeoffs of SWIPT. It was shown that
there exist a nontrivial tradeoff in maximizing information
rate versus power transfer since the quantity of information
contained in the RF signal is determined by the amount
of “variations”, i.e., entropy rate, while its carried power is
determined by the average squared value of the amplitude.
In [6], this tradeoff was further extended to frequency-selective
channels. Zhang and Ho [7] investigated the information-
energy tradeoff of SWIPT ove r a three-node multiple-input-
multiple-output (MIMO) broadcasting channel in terms of
rate-energy (R-E) region . In their work, two scenarios were
examined, i.e., the separated information decoding (ID) and
EH receivers scenario where the EH and ID receivers have
different MIMO channels from the transmitter, and the co-
located EH and ID receivers scenario where the EH and ID
receivers have identical MIMO channels from the transmitter.
Zhang and Ho [7] also pointed out that it is impractical for
EH and ID receivers to receive in formation and collect energy
using the same circuit as the EH and ID receivers have very
different power sensitivities and the EH operation performed
in the RF domain destroys the information content. Therefore,
two practical receiver architectures (i.e., time switching (TS)
and power splitting (PS)) were proposed in [7] for the co-
located receivers scenario. So far, SWIPT has become an
appealing EH technique and been applied to various wireless
communication networks [8]–[18]. For example, in [25]–[27],
multiuser MISO broadcast SWIPT systems were investigated,
where the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers
was maximized in [25], the total transmission power at BS
was minimized [26], and the capacity region for ID receivers
was explored [27], respectively.
However, in all works mentioned above, the linear
EH model was adopted, where the power conversion efﬁciency

of the RF-EH circuit, deﬁned as the ratio of the output
direct currency (DC) power to the input RF signal power,
was considered to be constant. That is, the output DC power
was assumed to be independent of the input power level of
the EH circuit. Recently, by m easurement with real RF-EH
circuit data, the authors in [28] found that in practical systems,
RF-EH circuits usually show a nonlinear end-to-end RF-EH
behavior rather than the linear one. Therefore, using the linear
EH model in SWIPT system design may result in the mismatch
and system performance degr adation. To accurately capture
the property of practical RF-EH circuits, [28] presented a
nonlinear EH model based on the logistic function and real
data. With the nonlinear EH model, [28] and [29] studied
the resource allocation for multi-user SWIPT systems. It was
shown that a substantial performance gain could be achieved
when the resource allocation is performed with the nonlin-
ear EH model instead of traditional linear EH model. Most
recently, a few works began to study SWIPT systems with the
nonlinear EH model, such as robu st beamforming design [30],
wireless power transfer efﬁciency maximization [31] and sys-
tem outage analysis [32], [33].
As the nonlinear EH model is more practical and more
accurate, in this paper, we focus on examining the performance
limits of SWIPT MIMO broadcasting channel under the non-
linear EH model. In our work, the R-E region is adopted as
the system performance index, as it is effective to characterize
the tradeoff between the information and energy transfer,
which may provide some fundamental and useful references
in optimally designing SWIPT-enabled systems [9]. Similar
to [7], two scenarios, i.e., the separated and the co-located
EH and ID receivers scenarios, are considered. For the
co-located EH and ID receivers scenario, both TS and PS
receiver architectures are investigated.
The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows.
Firstly, for the two MIMO scenarios with PS and TS
receiver architectures, we derive the boundaries of their
R-E regions, where some optimization problems on maximiz-
ing the harvested energy are studied under a given information
rate threshold with the nonlinear EH model constraint. Since
the problems are non-convex and cannot be directly solved by
using known solution methods, we propose efﬁcient methods
to solve them. We prove that the nonlinear EH model is
a mathematically increasing function w.r.t. the received RF
signal power. Therefore, the optimal solution of the nonlinear
EH model system may have a similar structure with that of
the linear EH model system in [7].
It is by no means that the optimal solution of the nonlinear
EH model system can be directly derived by plugging the ana-
lytical result of the nonlinear system in the solution structure
of the linear EH system. The reason is explained as follows.
In [7], the R-E boundaries of the linear EH systems were
obtained by solving some optimization problems, in which the
information rate was maximized under the harvested energy
constraint. In linear EH model case, these problems are convex
and can be easily solved. But in nonlinear EH model case, they
are non-convex due to the nonlinear EH constraints, resulting
in the difﬁculty to solve them. As an alternative, we con-
sider the maximization problems, in which the harvested
energy is maximized under the constraint of information rate,
to draw the boundaries of the R-E regions for the nonlinear
EH systems. By doing so, we can obtain some semi-closed
results on the optimal solutions and then design efﬁcient
solution algorithms. Therefore, both the considered problems
and the solution methods are different from those in [7].
Secondly, we also obtain some new results on the nonlinear
EH system design compared with [7]. For example, for the
TS system with the linear EH model, Zhang and Ho [7]
found that the minimal consumed power at the transmitter
for the EH receiver to harvest power is independent of
the time switching factor. In contrast, for the TS system
with the nonlinear EH model, we found that the minimal
consumed power at the transmitter for the EH receiver to
harvest power is closely dependent on the time switching
factor. Thus, we design new solution method for the TS MIMO
broadcasting system with the nonlinear EH model and our
obtained results are very different from those of the linear
EH model in [7]. Besides, for the PS system with the linear
EH model, the optimal power splitting factors were searched
with a small step size over the interval [0,1] in [7], which
may be too computationally complex for the system with a
relatively large number of antennas. While, for the PS system
with the nonlinear EH model, we ﬁnd the optimal power
splitting factors by solving a convex problem and derive a
semi-closed form expression for them, which is with low
complexity.
Thirdly, numerical results with different circuit parame-
ter conﬁgurations are provided to evaluate the system per-
formance under the nonlinear EH model, which provides
some interesting insights on the SWIPT MIMO broadcasting
channel. It is shown that all pr actical circuit speciﬁcations
greatly affect the system R-E region. Compared with the
systems under current linear EH model, the ones under the
practical nonlinear EH model achieve smaller R-E regions and
show different R-E tradeoff behaviors. Particularly, with the
increment of R, the average maximum harvested energy in the
separated EH and ID receivers system and in the PS system
with the nonlinear EH model d ecreases with an increasing
declining rate, but decreases with an almost constant declining
rate in the TS system with the nonlinear EH model. Addition-
ally, the PS system achieves larger average R-E region than
the TS one under the nonlinear EH model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model. Section III and Section IV inves-
tigate the R-E regions for the separated receivers scenario and
the co-located receivers scenario , respectively, by formulating
and solving corresponding optimization problems. Section V
provides some simulation results and ﬁnally Section VI con-
cludes the paper.

II. S YSTEM MODEL
We consider a MIMO broadcasting network consisting of
one transmitter, one EH receiver and one ID receiver, where
all nodes are equipped with multiple antennas and the numbers
of antennas at the transmitter, the EH and the ID receivers are
denoted by N
T, NE and NI, respectively. Let HE ∈ CNE×NT
and HI ∈ CNI×NT be the channel matrices between the
transmitter and the EH receiver and between the transmitter
and the ID receiver, respectively. Quasi-static fading channel
is assumed at each fading state. Both H
E and HI are known at
the transmitter and the corresponding receivers so that energy
beamforming or information precoding can be performed at
the transmitter to enhance the system performance.
Denote s(k) ∈ C
NT×1 as the baseband signal broadcast
by the transmitter at the k-th symbol interval. Without loss
of generality, s(k) is assumed to be random over k. Q =
E[s(k)s(k)H ] is the covariance matrix of s(k) satisfying that
E[∥s(k)∥2]= Tr(Q) ≤ P,w h e r eP is the average available
power at the transmitter over all transmit antennas. There-
fore, the received signal at the EH and ID receivers can be
respectively given by y
E(k) = HEs(k) + nE(k) and yI(k) =
HIs(k) + nI(k), where nE(k) ∈ CNE×1 ∼ CN (0,σ 2
E I) and
nI(k) ∈ CNI ×1 ∼ CN (0,σ 2
I I) are the noise received at the EH
and ID receivers, respectively. For the EH receiver, the input
power is E[∥HEs(k)∥2]= Tr(HEQHH
E ). With the traditional
linear EH model, the harvested energy at the EH receiver is
given by
Elinear = ηE[∥HEs(k)∥2]= ηTr(HEQHH
E ), (1)
where η ∈ (0,1] is a constant, denoting the energy conversion
efﬁciency and it is independent of the input power level at the
EH receiver.
More recently, [28] found that the practical EH circuit
results in a nonlinear end-to-end wireless power transfer so
that they presented a nonlin ear EH model based on the
measurement data of practi cal EH circuits, which is more
accurate to describe the char acteristics of EH circuits. With
the nonlinear EH model [28], [34], the harvested energy at
the EH receiver can be given by
Enonlinear =

(
−a(Tr(HEQHH
E )−b)
) − M
1+exp(ab)
1 − 1
1+exp(ab)
≜ /Psi1
(
Tr(HEQHH
E )
)
. (2)
In (2), /Psi1(x) is deﬁned as a function of x, i.e., /Psi1(x) =
β(x)−M/Omega1
1−/Omega1, where /Omega1= 1
1+exp(ab) and β(x) = M
1+exp(−a(x−b))
which is the traditional logistic function w.r.t. x. M is a con-
stant, indicating the maximum harvested power at EH receiver
when the EH circuit is saturated. Parameters a and b are
constants depending on the detailed circuit speciﬁcations,
such as resistance, capacitance and diode turn-on voltage.
In practice, a, b,a n d M can be easily found by a standard
curve ﬁtting tool. Such a nonlinear EH model is capable of
capturing the joint effect of the nonlinear phenomena induced
by hardware constraints, e.g., circuit sensitivity limitations and
current leakage [28].
It can be seen in (1) that with the linear EH model,
the harvested energy can be increased with the increment of
input power without limitation, while in (2), it was shown that
with the nonlinear model, when the input power is relatively
low, the harvested energy is increased with the increment
of input power and the increasing rate is closely dependent
on the parameters a and b. Moreover, there is a limitation
on the maximum possible harvested energy for the nonlinear
EH model. As the nonlinear EH model is more general and
more accurate for practical EH sy stems, we shall investigate
the MIMO broadcasting channel with it.
By observing (1) and (2), we obtain the following result.
Proposition 1: For the same H
E and Q, the harvested
energy of the nonlinear EH model over the MIMO broadcast-
ing channel is bounded by that of the linear EH model with
η = 1, i.e., E nonlinear ≤ Elinear|η=1.
Proof: From (1), the harvested energy of the linear
EH model is ηTr(HEQHH
E ). From (2) of the nonlinear model,
the input power is Tr (HEQHH
E ) and the harvested energy is
Enonlinear. Due to the law of conservation of energy, it is known
that Enonlinear ≤ Tr(HEQHH
E ).T h a ti sEnonlinear ≤ Elinear|η=1.
In such a system, for the ID receiver, its obtained informa-
tion rate can be given by [35]

It was proved in [7] that the maximal information delivering
and power transfer are different from each other, which involve
information spatial multiplexing and energy beamforming,
respectively. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between them under
given available power constraint, which can be described
by the R-E region. Assuming the continuously transmitted
signals from the transmitter is Gaussian signals, for example,
the R-E region of MIMO channel with separated EH and ID
receivers can be given by

As shown in Figure 1, there are two different scenarios for
the MIMO broadcasting system. The ﬁrst one is with separated
EH and ID receivers, see Figure 1 (a), and the second one is
with co-located EH and ID receivers, see Figure 1 (b). For the
co-located EH and ID receivers scenario, two practical receiver
architectures, i.e., TS and PS receiver architectures, were
proposed in [7]. With TS architecture employed, the receiver
switches in time domain between the EH and ID receivers
and the entire signal received in one time slot is used either
for ID or EH, as shown in Figure 1 (b). With PS architecture
employed, the received signals are split into two streams of
different power levels in terms of a PS factor, where one signal
stream is sent to the rectenna circuit for EH and the other is
converted to baseband for ID, as shown in Figure 1 (b)(2).
Comparatively, the TS archit ecture allows for a simple hard-
ware implementation at the receiver but requires accurate time

synchronization and information/energy scheduling while the
PS architecture doesn’t need accurate time synchronization
and information/energy scheduling but requires a relatively
complex hardware implementation.
In Section III and IV, we shal l respectively discuss the
R-E regions of the MIMO broadcasting system with separated
receivers and co-located receivers, respectively.
III. R-E R EGION FOR SEPARATED EH AND ID R ECEIVERS
In this section, we consider the MIMO broadcasting system
with separated EH and ID receivers, whose R-E region is
described by (4). To ﬁgure out the R-E region, the four
points on the region boundary, i.e., (0, Emax),( REH, Emax),
(Rmax, EID) and (Rmax,0) on the R-E coordinate plane, should
be determined at ﬁrst.
A. Calculation of E max
To ﬁnd out Emax, the case when the ID receiver is not
present should be considered. In this case, the objective of the
MIMO system design is to maximize the harvested energy
E under the transmitter’s power constraint, which can be
express by
P1 : max
QE
Enonlinear = /Psi1
(
Tr(HEQEHH
E )
)
s.t. Tr(QE) ≤ P, QE⪰ 0, (5)
where QE is the energy beamforming covariance matrix at the
transmitter, which is require d to be optimized. Although the
two constraints in Problem P1 are convex sets, the objective
function /Psi1(Tr(HEQEHH
E )) is neither convex nor concave
w.r.t QE. So, it cannot be directly solved by using standard
solution method for convex problems. However, fortunately,
we found the following property of the objective function.
Lemma 1: /Psi1(x) is a monotonically increasing function
w.r.t x .
Proof: Suppose x1 > x2 > 0. It can be easily proved that
/Psi1(x1) − /Psi1(x2) > 0 always holds by some simple algebraic
operations. Therefore, Lemma 1 is proved.
Lemma 1 indicates the following two facts:
Fact 1: E nonlinear = /Psi1
(
Tr(HEQEHH
E )
)
is an injective
function w.r.t Tr(HEQEHH
E ),v i s ev e r s a ;
Fact 2: Al a r g e rT r(HEQEHH
E ) yields a higher Enonlinear.
Lemma 2: Suppose f (x) is a concave function
and Ϝ ( f (x)) is a monotonically increasing function
of f (x), then the two optimization problems,
i.e., max x f (x) subject to C 1(x),C2(x) ,..., Cm (x) and
maxx Ϝ ( f (x)) subject to C 1(x),C2(x) ,..., Cm (x) have the
same optimal solution (but usually different optimal values of
the objective functions), where C i (x) is a convex set for all
i = 1,..., m.
Proof: Since the two problems have the same constraints,
they have the same feasible solution sets. Moreover, as f (x) is
concave, there exists a unique optimal solution x∗ for problem
maxx f (x) subject to C1(x), C2(x), ... , Cm (x) such that
f (x∗) achieves the maximum. Suppose there exists another
x♯ satisfying that β( f (x♯)) > Ϝ ( f (x∗)).A s β( f (x)) is a
monotonically increasing function of f (x), it indicates that
f (x♯)> f (x∗), which contradicts that x∗ is the optimal
solution of max x f (x). Therefore, such a x♯ does not exist,
which implies that Ϝ ( f (x∗)) achieves its maximum, i.e., x∗ is
also the optimal solution of the optimization problem Ϝ ( f (x))
subject to C1(x), C2(x), ... , Cm (x).
According to Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, it can be deduced
that Problem P1 has the same solution of the following
Problem P′
1, i.e.,
P′
1 : max
QE
Tr(HEQEHH
E ) s.t. Tr(QE) ≤ P, QE⪰ 0. (6)
It means that once the optimal Q∗
E of Problem P′
1 is found,
by substituting it into the objective function of Problem P1,
one can obtain Emax. Since Problem P′
1 has the similar form
to the problem P1 in [7], the optimal solution of Problem P′
1
can be accordingly given by
Q∗
E = Pv(1)
E (v(1)
E )H , (7)
where v(1)
E is the ﬁrst column of VE. VE ∈ CNT×min{NT ,NE}
is obtained by the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
channel matrix HE, i.e., HE = UE/Sigma1EVH

CNT×min{NT ,NE}, each of which consists orthogonal columns
with unit norm. Consequently,
Emax = /Psi1(h(e)
1 P). (8)
B. Calculation of R max
To ﬁnd out Rmax, the case when the EH receiver is not
present should be considered. In this case, the objective of the
MIMO system design is to maximize the received information
R under the transmitter’s power constraint, which can be
expressed by

According to [35], the optimal solution follows the following
structure, i.e.,

1,2,..., min{NT, NI},w h e r eν is a positive constant (the

the corresponding maximum information rate can be given by
Rmax =
∑ min{NT,NI}
i=1 log
(
1 + pi h(I)

I
)
. (11)
Now, with the obtained Emax and Rmax above, the other
two boundary points i.e., (REH, Emax) and (Rmax, EID) of
the R-E region can be obtained. We consider the case where
EH and ID receivers are co-exist to determine REH and EID.
Speciﬁcally, REH is the achieved information rate at the ID
receiver when the transmitter adopts the optimal precoding
matrix in (7) to achieve E
max at the EH receiver. Thus, we have
REH = log
(
1 + P
σ2
I
∥HIv(1)
E ∥2
)
. EID is the harvested energy
at the EH receiver when the transmitter adopts the optimal
beam matrix in (10) to achieve Rmax at the ID receiver and it
can be given by EID = /Psi1
(
Tr(VI/Lambda1SI VH
I )
)
.
C. R-E Region of the Separated EH and ID Receivers System
When R ≤ REH, Emax is achievable at the EH receiver with
the transmit covariance matrix in (7) adopted at the transmitter.
When E ≤ EID, Rmax is achievable at the ID receiver with the
transmit covariance matrix in (10) adopted at the transmitter.
Therefore, it only needs to determine the boundary of CR-E
over the intervals REH ≤ R ≤ Rmax and EID ≤ E ≤ Emax on
the R-E plane. To do so, either of the following optimization
problems can be considered, i.e.,

that in Problem P3, the objective function is concave, but
the constraint, /Psi1
(
Tr(HEQHH

)
≥ E, is a non-convex set.
In Problem P4, all the constraints are convex sets but the
objective function is neither convex nor concave. Hence, both
Problem P3 and Problem P4 are non-convex and cannot
be directly solved. However, we found that by solving the
following Problem P′

Problem P4.

Lemma 3: Problem P′

Problem P4.
Proof: One can see that the constraint sets of both
Problem P4 and Problem P′
4 are the same. According
to Fact 1, Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, it can be easily
proved that Problem P4 has the same optimal solution with
Problem P′
4.
Therefore, we consider Problem P4 and Problem P′
4 to
determine the boundary of the R-E region for MIMO broad-
casting with separated EH and ID receivers. 1 The Lagrangian
of Problem P′

where μ and ν are non-negative Lagrangian multipliers. Then,
the Lagrangian dual function of Problem P′

L (Q,μ,ν) (16)
and the dual problem of Problem P′
4 is
min G (μ, ν) s.t. μ ≥ 0,ν ≥ 0. (17)

convex set. So, Problem P3 in the linear EH case is a convex problem.
Therefore, in [7], Problem P3 was considered to drive the R-E region of
linear EH model system rather than Problem P4.

Now, we begin to solve the dual problem (17) by adopt-
ing the sub-gradient method, which can be described by
Algorithm 1, where current optimal Q∗ is calculated according
to (18) with the given μ(n) and ν(n) and then the sub-gradient
of G (μ, ν) is calculated and μ(n) and ν(n) are updated with an
appropriate step size of the n-th iteration, ϱ (n).2 When μ(n)
and ν(n) converge to the pre-deﬁned precision ϵ, the global
optimal μ∗ and ν∗ are obtained. Substituting them into (18),
the global optimal Q∗, i.e. the optimal solution of Problem P′
4
and P4, can be derived. Note that as Problem P4 is a convex
problem, the duality gap between it and its dual problem is
zero, which means the global optimal solution is guaranteed.

Proposition 2: The R-E region of the MIMO broadcasting
channel with separated EH and ID receiver under the nonlin-
ear EH model is bounded by that under linear EH model with
η = 1.
Proof: From Proposition 1, we know that the maxi-
mal harvested energy under the nonlinear EH model must
be equal or lower than that the linear EH model with
η = 1, i.e., E
(nonlinear)
max ≤ E(linear)
max . Moreover, the R(nonlinear)
max
in (11) is the same with that of the linear EH model,
i.e., R(nonlinear)
max = R(linear)
max . This means that the four points,
2The value of ϱ (n) should be selected according t o backtracking line search
method [36] for achieving fast convergence.
(0, Emax), ( REH, Emax), (Rmax, EID) and (Rmax,0) on the
region boundary of the nonlinear model is bounded by those
of the linear model. Furthermore, since Problem P4 has the
same optimal solution with Problem P′
4, combining it with
Proposition 1, it can be known that the optimal value of
Problem P4 can not be larger than that of Problem P′
4,w h i c h
means that the boundary curve associated with the nonlinear
model from R
EH to Rmax is also bounded by that associated
with the linear model with η = 1. As a result, Proposition 2
is arrived.
IV . R-E R EGION OF CO-LOCATED EH AND ID R ECEIVERS
When EH and ID receivers are co-located, HE = HI and
NE = NI. For convenience, we deﬁne H ≜ HE = HI and
N ≜ NE = NI. To ﬁgure out the R-E region described by (4)
for the co-located receiver case, the two points on the boundary
of the R-E region should be determined at ﬁrst, i.e., (0, Emax)
and (Rmax,0). It can be easily known that the results asso-
ciated with Emax and Rmax shown in (8) and (10) still hold
for the co-located receiver case. Therefore, the boundary of
the R-E region can be determined by considering following
optimization problem,
P
5 : max
Q
Enonlinear = /Psi1
(
Tr(HQHH )
)
s.t. log | I + 1
σ2 HQHH |≥ R, Tr(Q) ≤ P, Q⪰ 0,
(20)
where R takes values from 0 to Rmax.
A. Time Switching
With the time switching recei ver architecture, the time
switcher switches the signal input between the EH and ID
receivers in time domain with a time switching factor θ,w h e r e
0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. Similar to [7], two types of power constraints can
be considered for the TS system, i.e., ﬁxed power and ﬂexible
power constraints. For ﬁxed power constraint, its R-E region
is expressed as
C TS1
R-E ≜
⋃
0≤θ≤1
{
(R, E) | E ≤ θ/Psi1
(
Tr(HQEHH )
)
,
R ≤ (1 − θ) log |I + 1
σ2 HQIHH |,
Tr(QE) ≤ P, Tr(QI) ≤ P, QE,QI⪰ 0
}
. (21)
For ﬂexible power constraint, its R-E region can be
expressed as
C TS2
R-E ≜
⋃
0≤θ≤1
{
(R, E) | E ≤ θ/Psi1
(
Tr(HQEHH )
)
,
R ≤ (1 − θ) log |I + 1
σ2 HQIHH |,
θTr(QE) + (1 − θ)Tr(QI) ≤ P,QE,QI⪰ 0
}
. (22)
Since any pair of (QE⪰ 0,QI⪰ 0) satisfying the ﬁxed
power constraint always satisfy the ﬂexible power constraint,
the result C
TS1
R-E ⊆ C TS2
R-E obtained in [7] with under linear
EH model also holds for the nonlinear EH model. Our
goal is to explore the potential achievable R-E region of the
MIMO broadcasting channel under the nonlinear EH model.

Therefore, in the following, we only focus on the boundary
of C TS2
R-E .
For a given θ, according to (8), the maximal energy can be
harvested is θ/Psi1(PEh1) when QE = PEv(1)
H (v(1)
H )H ,w h e r eh1
is obtained by the SVD of channel matrix H. v(1)
H is the
eigenvector of the matrix HH H corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue h1 and PE is the consumed transmit power for
energy transfer. In order to harvest energy with amount of E,
we can calculate the minimal consumed power by solving E =
θ/Psi1(PEh1).S i n c e/Psi1−1(x) = 1
a ln
( x

x

)
, we have
that h1 PE = 1
a ln
( E/θ
M exp(ab)+1
E/θ

)
. As a result, the minimal
consumed power at the transmitter for the EH receiver to
harvest power E is given by
PE = 1
ah1
ln
( E/θ
M exp(ab)+1
1+ E/θ
M
)
,
which depends on θ. This result is very different from that of
the linear EH model case in [7], where the minimum consumed
energy is independent of θ. Thus, the method proposed in [7]
cannot be used to explore the R-E region of (22). Instead, we
consider the following optimization problem to determine the
boundary of C
TS2
R-E .

σ2 HQIHH |≥ R,
θTr(QE) + (1 − θ)Tr(QI) ≤ P,
QE, QI⪰ 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. (23)
It is observed that Problem P6 is not joint convex w.r.t QE, QI
and θ due to the coupling of them, so the optimal solution of
the three variables cannot be jointly solved by using known
convex optimization solution methods. Therefore, we solve it
as follows.
1) Optimal Q

σ2 HQIHH |≥ R,
θTr(QE) + (1 − θ)Tr(QI) ≤ P,
QE⪰ 0, QI⪰ 0, (24)
which is non-convex. Nevertheless, similar to Problem P4,
we found that problem (24) has the same optimal solution
with the following optimization problem, i.e.,
max
QE,QI
Tr(HQEHH )
s.t. (1 − θ) log |I + 1
σ2 HQIHH |≥ R,
θTr(QE) + (1 − θ)Tr(QI) ≤ P, QE⪰ 0, QI⪰ 0, (25)
which is joint convex w.r.t QE and QI, and can be solved by
using convex optimization methods.
2) Optimal θ♯ for Given QE and QI: With the optimal
solution of (25), i.e., (Q♯
E,Q♯
I ), problem (23) is expressed by
max

the larger θ, the higher θ/Psi1

. According to the
above analysis, Lemma 5 is proved.

contribution of θ to F is larger than that of Tr (QE) to F , F
will increase. Otherwise, F will decrease. It means that F is
an increasing function or a ﬁrstly increasing and then decreas-
ing function. For both cases, there exists a maximum F ∗.
In Algorithm 2, for a given Q♯
E and Q♯
I , θ is optimized to
increase F , which means that the value of θ associated with
current iteration is always larger than that associated with the
previous one. If ε is set to be a very small positive number,
Algorithm 2 can converge to the optimal F ∗.
Proposition 3: The R-E region of the MIMO broadcasting
channel with TS receiver under the nonlinear EH model is
bounded by that under the linear EH model with η = 1.
Proof: Similar to the proof of Proposition 2, we have that
E(nonlinear)
max ≤ E(linear)
max and R(nonlinear)
max = R(linear)
max . Moreover,
as Problem (24) has the same optimal solution to (25), com-
bining it with Proposition 1, the optimal value of (24) cannot
be larger than that of (25), which means that the R-E boundary
associated with the nonlinear model from 0 to R
max is bounded
by that associated with the linear model with η = 1. Hence,
Proposition 3 is proved.
B. Power Splitting
With power splitting receiver architecture, the received
signal at each receiving antenna of the receiver is splitted into
two streams by a power splitter with a power splitting factor
ρ,w h e r e√
ρ part is input into the EH receiver and the rest√
1 − ρ is input into the ID receiver. Similar to [7], we also
consider the practical case, where σ2
A ≪ σ2
P and σ2 = σ2
A+σ2
P .
σ2
A and σ2
P are the noise power induced by the antenna and
the baseband signal processing, respectively. The R-E region
obtained in this case can be approximately regarded as a lower
bound of the PS scheme.3 As the antenna noise can be ignored,
it is assumed that σ2
A = 0a n d σ2
P = 1. This is equivalent to
the situation that the aggregated receiver noise power remains
constant with a power splitter at each receiving antenna.
Let ρi be the power splitting ratio associated with the i-th
receiving antenna, 0 ≤ ρi ≤ 1a n d i = 1,..., N. Particularly,
when ρi ∈{ 0,1}, the PS architecture reduces to a new receiver
architecture, i.e., antenna switc hing (AS) architecture, where
ρi = 1 indicates that the i-th antenna is switched to transfer
power and ρi = 0 indicates that the i-th antenna is switched
to transmit information. Ther efore, AS architecture actually
is a special case of PS architecture and PS-based systems
have larger R-E regions than AS-based systems. Since our
goal is to explore the potential achievable R-E regions of
practical MIMO broadcasting channels, we investigate the PS
architecture to achieve generality.
3With power splitting, the noise of σ2
A is divided into two parts, where
(1 − ρ)σ 2
A is input into the information receiver. Thus, the total noise for
information decoding is (1−ρ)σ 2

P = σ2, which has the biggest total noise for information
decoding and yields the smallest R-E region among all cases [7]. Therefore,
when σ2

P , the obtained R-E region can be approximately considered
as a performance lower bound for the PS scheme with nonlinear EH model.

Convergence analysis : It is known that Tr (Q) represents
the transmit power and Tr (/Omega1ρHQHH ) represents the received
RF power. Higher transmit power leads to higher received
RF power, so Tr (/Omega1ρHQHH ) increases with the increment
of Tr (Q).F o rag i v e n /Omega1ρ, to maximize Tr (/Omega1ρHQHH ),
Tr(Q) should be its maximum value P. In this case,
if log |I + 1

Tr(/Omega1ρHQHH ). Until when log |I + 1

fore, there exists a maximum Tr (/Omega1ρHQHH ). In Algorithm 3,
for a given Q♯, /Omega1ρ is optimized to increase Tr (/Omega1ρHQHH ),
which means that /Omega1ρ associated with current iteration is
always increased over the proper cone RNT

that associated with the previous iteration. Therefore, with a
small positive value of ε, Algorithm 3 can converge to the

Proposition 4: The R-E region of the MIMO broadcasting
channel with PS receiver architecture under the nonlinear
EH model is bounded by that under linear EH model with
η = 1.
Proof: Similar to the proof of Proposition 2, we have that
E

max ≤ E(linear)
max and R(nonlinear)
max = R(linear)
max .M o r e o v e r ,
since Problem (32) has the same optimal solution with Prob-
lem (33), combining it with Proposition 1, the optimal value
of Problem (32) cannot be larger than that of Problem (33).
Besides, from the solution method for Problem (31), it is
also known that the optimal value of Problem (31) must be
equal or smaller than that associated with the linear EH model.
As a result, the optimal value of Problem P
7 also must be
equal or smaller that the optimization problem associated with
the linear EH model, which means that the boundary curve
associated with the nonlinear model from 0 to R
max is bounded
by that associated with the linear model with η = 1. Therefore,
Proposition 4 is proved.
V. N UMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section provides some numerical results to show the
R-E region of the SWIPT MIMO broacasting channel with
nonlinear EH model. In the simulations, the system bandwidth
is set to be 1MHz. The receiver antenna noise power density
is −100dBm/Hz. Path loss factor is assumed to be 4 and
the available transmit power at the transmitter is 2Watt. For
comparison, the R-E region of the SWIPT MIMO broacasting
channel with traditional linear EH model is also simulated,
where η is set to 1 and the R-E region of the linear EH model
system is derived by solving the corresponding optimization
problem in [7]. For our considered nonlinear EH model, two
groups of circuit parameters, i.e., (a = 6400,b = 0.003) and
(a = 1500,b = 0.0022) provided by [28], [37], [38], and [39],
are adopted, and the R-E region of the nonlinear EH model
system is calculated with our newly obtained theoretical results
and the algorithms in this paper. In order to clearly show the
difference performance of lin ear EH model and the nonlinear
EH model, we illustrate the linear EH model and the nonlinear
EH model as shown in Figure 2, where the harvested energy
versus the input RF power is plotted. For the linear EH model,
it is with η = 1 and for the nonlinear EH model, it is generated
in terms of (2) with the parameters mentioned previously.
These system conﬁgurations and parameter settings will not
change unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Note that M indicates the maximum harvested power at
receiver when the EH circuit is saturated. In practical systems,
the values of M are determined by EH circuits and may
be much different due to circuit designs. In the simulations,
we just want to show the effect trends of different values
of M on system R-E regions rather than real values of M.
As described in Proposition 1, the maximum harvested energy
of nonlinear EH model is also bounded by that of the linear
EH model, i.e., E
max. Thus, when M > Emax, the maxi-
mum harvested energy of nonlinear EH model is not larger
than Emax. Therefore, we select Emax as a reference value of

A. R-E Region of the Separated Receivers Scenario
Firstly, we provide some results to show the R-E region
of MIMO broadcasting channel with separated EH and ID
receivers. In the simulations, the distances between the trans-
mitter and the EH receiver and between the transmitter and
the ID receiver were set to be 7m and 50m, respectively. The
channels were generated following Rayleigh distribution.
In Figure 3 and Figure 4, we provide two examples with
speciﬁed channel matrices to show the R-E region of the
MIMO channel with separated EH and ID receivers, where
NT = NE = NI = 2 in Figure 3 and NT = NE = NI = 4
in Figure 4. In Figure 3, HE =[ − 0.0583 + 0.5942i −
0.3104 + 0.0708i;− 1.3669 − 0.6279i − 1.2690 − 0.3850i]
and HI =[ 0.2146 + 1.2105i 0.3465 − 1.5120i;− 0.4245 −
0.1373i 0.5228 − 0.5937i] and in Figure 4, HE and HI are
respectively shown in (36) and (37), as shown at the bottom
of this page. In both ﬁgures, M = Emax, M = 0.7Emax and
M = 0.3Emax are considered, where Emax is obtained in terms
of Emax = h(e)
1 P, which is the maximum energy that can be
harvested over the MIMO channel with the linear EH model.
Fig. 3. Example 1: R-E region of MIMO broadcasting channel with separated
receivers for speciﬁed HE and HI,w h e r eNT = NE = NI = 2.
Fig. 4. Example 2: R-E region of MIMO broadcasting channel with separated
receivers for speciﬁed HE and HI,w h e r eNT = NE = NI = 4.
It can be observed that for the same (a,b)-pair conﬁguration,
the larger the value of M, the larger the R-E region. The reason
is that a larger M may bring a higher maximum power (when
the EH circuit is saturated) that can be harvested at the
EH receiver. Moreover, for the same M, the R-E regions asso-
ciated with different pairs of (a,b) show very different bound-
ary shapes. Speciﬁcally, with the increment of R, the maximal
harvested energy of the system with (a = 6400,b = 0.003)

declines much faster than that of the system with (a =
1500,b = 0.0022), but the maximal harvested energy of the
system with (a = 6400,b = 0.003) decreases later than
that of the system with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022). Besides,
the declining rate of the system with (a = 6400,b = 0.003)
ﬁrst increases and then decreas es while that of the system with
(a = 6400,b = 0.003) gradually increases. The reason is that
different values of (a,b) yield very different EH behaviors,
as shown in Figure 2 of [28]. For the EH circuit with (a =
6400,b = 0.003), the increasing rate of the harvested power
decreases with the increment of the input RF power, but for the
EH circuit with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022), the increasing rate
of the harvested power ﬁrst increases and then decreases with
the increment of the input RF power. Additionally, it is also
observed that the R-E regions associated with the nonlinear
EH model are covered by the regions associated with the linear
EH model, 4 which is consistent with Proposition 2. Particu-
larly, in Figure 4, a part of the boundary of the R-E region
associated with M = Emax,a = 1500,b = 0.0022 overlaps
that of the traditional linear EH model, which implies that
with some proper circuit parameters and certain channel gains,
the R-E region obtained with the traditional linear EH model
may be achievable in practical non-linear systems.
In Figure 5 and Figure 6, the average R-E regions of
the MIMO broadcasting channel with separated EH and ID
receivers are plotted for N
T = NE = NI = 2a n d NT =
NE = NI = 4, respectively. Every point on the boundary of
the R-E region was averaged over 100 channel realizations.
From the two ﬁgures, the average R-E region associated with
(a = 6400,b = 0.003) is always a subset of the corresponding
one associated with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022), which means
the circuit with parameters (a = 1500,b = 0.0022) has
better average system performance than that of the circuit with
parameters (a = 6400,b = 0.003). Moreover, the average
4This does not means that the linear EH model is superior to the nonlinear
EH model, as the the R-E region obtained with the EH model actually may
not always be achievable in practical systems due to the nonlinear EH circuit
features.

R-E region associated with the 4 × 4 × 4-antenna system is
larger than that associated with the 2 × 2 × 2-antenna system,
which means that by equipping more antennas in SWIPT
systems, a larger R-E region can be achieved.
B. R-E Region of Co-Located Receivers Scenario
Secondly, we provide some results to show the R-E region
of MIMO broadcasting channel with co-located EH and ID
receivers. In the simulations, the distances between the trans-
mitter and the receiver was set to be 8m. The channels were
also generated following Rayleigh distribution.
In Figure 7, we present an example of the R-E region
of a 2 × 2 MIMO broadcasting channel with TS receiver
architecture, where H =[ − 0.1241 + 0.6715i 1.4090 +
0.7172i; 1.4897 − 1.2075i 1.4172 + 1.6302i]. In (22), P

be practical. Thus, we also simulate the R-E region of the TS
system with the peak power constraint, i.e., Ppeak ≤ 1.5P.
In Figure 7, for the same M, the systems with different
pairs of (a,b) have different R-E regions. The system with
(a = 6400,b = 0.003) has a larger R-E region than that
with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022). Moreover, the smaller M
results in a smaller R-E region, which means that in the
co-located receivers system with TS receiver architecture, both
M and (a,b) affect the system R-E tradeoff greatly. Besides,
the R-E region of the system with nonlinear EH model under
the peak power constraint of Ppeak ≤ 1.5P is very close to that
under Ppeak ≤+ inf. It is also observed that the R-E region of
the TS system under nonlinear EH model is bounded within
that of the TS system under traditional linear EH model, which
is consistent with Proposition 3. With the same channel and
system conﬁguration, Figure 8 plot the R-E region of the 2 ×2
MIMO broadcasting channel with PS receiver architecture.
The system with uniformed ρ where ρ1 = ρ2 =···= ρN
was also simulated for comparison. As expected, the system
with uniformed ρ achieves smaller R-E region compared with
the system with ﬂexible ρ, but the R-E region shape does not
change obviously. Moreover, the maximum harvested energy
associated with the system with uniformed ρ is obviously
lower than that of the system with ﬂexible ρ at the relatively
high R regime. It is also observed that the R-E region of the
PS system under nonlinear EH model is bounded within that
of the PS system under traditional linear EH model, which is
consistent with Proposition 4.
Figure 9 compares the R-E regions of the 2 × 2M I M O
broadcasting channel with PS and TS receiver architectures
under the nonlinear EH model, where the channel matrix H
is the same with that of Figure 7. It is observed that for the
same system parameters, the TS system shows very different
R-E tradeoff behaviour from PS system. That is, with the
increment of R, the maximum harvested energy gradually
decreases in the TS system while the maximum harvested
energy keeps stable at ﬁrst and then sharply decreases in the
PS system. For a relatively small R, the maximum harvested

energy of the PS system is higher than that of the TS system,
but for a relatively large R, the maximum harvested energy
of the PS system is lower than that of the TS system.
In Figure 10, the average R-E regions of the MIMO broad-
casting channel with colocated EH and ID receivers are plotted
for NT = NE = NI = 2. Both TS and PS receiver architectures
are simulated. Each point on the boundary of the R-E region
is obtained by averaging 100 randomly generated channel
realizations. It can be observed that the PS system has very
different system performance compared with the TS system.
For the same M, the PS system with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022)
achieves larger R-E region than that with (a = 6400,b =
0.003), but the TS system with (a = 1500,b = 0.0022)
achieves smaller R-E region than that with (a = 6400,b =
0.003). Moreover, for the PS system, with the increment of
R the maximum harvested energy ﬁrst decrease very slowly
and then decreases more and more sharply, while for the
TS system, with the increment of R the maximum harvested

energy decreases almost with th e same rate. Besides, with the
same system parameter conﬁguration, the R-E region of the
PS system is almost always larger than that of the TS system,
which means PS system is able to achieve better average R-E
tradeoff for MIMO broadcasting channel.
From the simulation results in this section, we obtain the
following results. 1) The variation of M greatly affects the size
of the R-E region of the MIMO broadcasting channel with
nonlinear EH model. 2) The parameters a and b determine
the shape of R-E region of the MIMO broadcasting channel
with nonlinear EH model. 3) The R-E region of the nonlinear
EH model system is bounded by that of linear EH model
system with η = 1. Nevertheless, the R-E region yielded
by the nonlinear EH model is more reasonable, which is
much closer to practice than that yielded by the linear EH
ymodel. 4) Basically, with the same system parameters, the PS
system always outperforms TS system under the nonlinear EH
ymodel.
VI. C
ONCLUSION
This paper studied the R-E region for MIMO broadcasting
channel under the nonlinear EH ymodel. Two different scenar-
ios were considered, i.e., th e separated EH and ID receivers
scenario and the co-located EH yand ID receivers scenario. For
the latter scenario, two practical receiver architectures, i.e., TS
and PS receiver architectures were investigated. By consid-
ering such a typical MIMO broadcasting system, several
optimization problems were formulated to derive the boundary
of the R-E region for the considered systems. As the problems
were non-convex, we derived some semi-closed-form solutions
and then designed efﬁcient algorithms to solve them. Numer-
ical results were provided to show the R-E regions of the
systems, which provide some interesting insights. It is shown
that all practical circuit speciﬁ cations greatly affect the system
R-E region. Compared with the systems under current linear
EH model, the ones under the practical nonlinear EH model
achieve smaller R-E regions and show different R-E tradeoff
behaviors. With the increment of R, the average maximum
harvested energy in the separated EH and ID receivers system
and in the PS system decreases with an increasing declining
rate, but decreases with an almost constant declining rate in
the PS system. Besides, the PS system achieves larger average
R-E region than the TS one. These results may provide some
useful insights for better understanding the multi-antenna
SWIPT system with nonlinear EH model. In this work, only
one ID and EH receivers were considered. In our future
work, we shall investigate the system with more ID and
EH receivers.
